1. About this project

  This is a fork of the [Github project](https://github.com/mehtank/androminion) from Ankur Metah which itself originated from the google code project "androminion", an android based	implementation of the game
  "Dominion" by Rio Grande Games.
  
  This fork was originally based on version r561 (2012-08-02) of the
  official project and has since been updated up to r638 (2012-08-31).
  
  Goals of Ankur's fork are:
  - A better User Interface, first for smartphones and later for tablets
    (done)
  - Better AI players, possibly using a neural network
    (work in progress)
  - Possibly a separate server and multiplayer functionality
    (later)
  - And of course some bug fixing and code commenting
    (partly done)
    
  Goals of lfrancke's fork are:
  - Code cleanup using mostly automatic refactoring (tabs to spaces and other things to make the code more consistent)
  - Minor bug fixes
  - Bring master branch up to date
